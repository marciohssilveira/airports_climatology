# Brazilian airports climatology

I used ISD database to gather, process and plot wind roses and other climatological data for some brazilian airports.

ISD License: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd/data-access

ISD Documentation: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/doc/isd-format-document.pdf

Part of this code was inspired by this notebook: https://gist.github.com/phobson/41b41bdd157a2bcf6e14

## Usage
`gather_data.py` downloads 10 years of data from the airports listed in `airports.txt` as well as path structure


`plot.py` creates the graphs for the airports as well as the path structure
